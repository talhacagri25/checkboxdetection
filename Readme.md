I needed a model which detects the checkboxes, whether they are ticked or not. I couldn't find any in the web. So, I had to create one. All the metrics are above %90. Dataset is trained for documents (handwritten as well). 

The model is in Google Drive link. If expires in future, open an issue.

Its trained with yolov8. Feel free to star and use it.
